Hi, I’m Muhammad Ikhwan Fathulloh, but you can call me Ikhwan. I’m currently working as a **Software Engineer** at the Directorate of Pusdatin, Bandung Technology University. Alongside my professional role, I’m building the **Nocturnailed IT Community**, mentoring, and freelancing with various companies.

I am also pursuing a **Master’s Degree** at ITB Stikom Bali, equipping myself with advanced knowledge to contribute further to the tech industry. Certified in **Internet of Things (IoT)** by BNSP and holding multiple other certifications, I have a strong foundation in cutting-edge technologies.
